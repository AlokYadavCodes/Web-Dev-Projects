# Web-Dev-Projects
A collection of all the web development projects since i started learning it (April 2024). This repo consists of two folders:

1. Tutorial Projects: These are the projects that are built by me after watching a tutorial or a course. I enjoy building these projects because these are great for learning concepts.
 
2. Personal Projects: These projects are my ideas, fun projects, solutions to the problem faced by me or in my surroundings. These projects are the implentation of the concepts learned by building 'Tutorial Projects'.
